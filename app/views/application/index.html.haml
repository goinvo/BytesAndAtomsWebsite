        %p
          Please join fellow designers, engineers, technologists and artists at Brightcove
          headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts as we explore the next great shift in
          interaction design.

        %p
          As we move beyond the screen, to connected devices and ubiquitous sensors, the
          internet of things enables us to know ourselves at greater fidelity (for good and
          bad), to plan our lives and cities better, and to engage with others more quickly
          and effectively.

        %p
          Through real-world stories and demonstrations, learn how people are combining
          data and physical products: From using sensors in retail spaces for generating
          customer interaction data and analytics, to measuring building performance for
          energy and occupancy, to controlling physical environments through gestural
          interaction.

        Brick and Mortar Data Shadows
      %p
        There are massive amounts of data that exist in the physical world
        that go un-noticed, un-captured and un-utilized, because we don't
        have direct access to it. For a brick-and-mortar store, knowing
        exactly how many people walked by versus how many come in their store
        compared to how many people stopped and looked at a particular
        product would be invaluable information. Every day, large amounts of
        this valuable physical-world data are going uncollected because it's
        either too difficult or too expensive to capture it. However, it's
        now easier and easier to collect data about the physical world.
        Because of this shift, we are currently deploying prototype sensor
        networks using Arduino and Processing in retail spaces to collect
        anonymous data about human movement. These new streams of physical
        world data allow us to understand patterns, contextualize behavior
        and make the invisible visible. These experiments are the tip of the
        iceberg for the future of retail analytics, but the business
        implications go far beyond simple retail analytics. Join Scott and
        Erik as they discuss their experiments and the coming implications of
        this new convergence.

        Leon's Interview: An ode to non-invasive, hyper surveillance
      %p
        Physiologic information are the patterns of life. Our biologic and
        digital signatures, like biometric identification, facial recognition,
        odor analysis, and health condition detection are rapidly converging
        into an aggregated data and decision space. Non-invasive hyper
        surveillance will eventually produce a majority of all personal
        "physiologic signs". And these early detection techniques combined with
        patient behavior change strategies can dramatically impact health
        outcomes. Get ready for a thought provoking lightning talk on the
        future of connected health with Juhan Sonin.
