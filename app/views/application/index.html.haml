      %h3 Tuesday, May 21 at Brightcove from 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM.

      %p
        Please join fellow designers, engineers, technologists and artists at Brightcove
        headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts as we explore the next great shift in
        interaction design.

      %p
        As we move beyond the screen, to connected devices and ubiquitous sensors, the
        internet of things enables us to know ourselves at greater fidelity (for good and
        bad), to plan our lives and cities better, and to engage with others more quickly
        and effectively.

      %p
        Through real-world stories and demonstrations, learn how people are combining
        data and physical products: From using sensors in retail spaces for generating
        customer interaction data and analytics, to measuring building performance for
        energy and occupancy, to controlling physical environments through gestural
        interaction.
